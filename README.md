# About these pages

Github pages are deployed automatically from this repository's master branch. The specific topic pages and their subtopic pages can be found in folders. 

The page layout is defined in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html) for the pages in Finnish and in [_layouts/default_en.html](_layouts/default_en.html) for the pages in English, and some values such as topic names are read from [_data/docs.yml](_data/docs.yml).

To run the site locally on you computer, you can create a local copy of the repository, use Git Bash and follow quickstart instructions on https://jekyllrb.com/
